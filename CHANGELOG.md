## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `MirLowerer` now borrows `symbols` and `known_functions` by reference instead of taking owned clones, eliminating per-function `FxHashMap` copies during the MIR lowering loop.
- `Lowerer::intern_symbol` uses a reverse lookup map (`name → SymbolId`) for O(1) deduplication instead of O(n) linear scan over the symbol table.
